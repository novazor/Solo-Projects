### Spam Detector (PyTorch)
- NLP classification model on emails (String inputs), labeling as spam or not spam
- Utilizes Word2Vec embeddings and NLTK for tokenization
- 99% Accuracy
- Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishabharathi/email-spam-dataset


### NLP Model (Tensorflow Keras)
- Sentiment Classification model using the public twitter_samples dataset from NLTK library.
- Allows an inputted tweet to receive either a positive or negative sentiment.
- Manual tweet inputs available

### Customer Churn Predictor (TensorFlow Keras)
- Predicts customer churn on a bank dataset
- Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset/data

### Handwritten (PyTorch)
- Image classification on inputted images of handwritten numbers
- Ten distinct classes (numbers 0-9)
-  Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/english-handwritten-characters-dataset

### Legendary Pokemon Predictor (PyTorch) 
- Confidence Prediction model predicting if a pokemon is legendary or not, outputting a confidence level.
- Input: The pokemon's numeric stats, such as its height, weight, base stats, type advantages, etc. Images are only used for show.
- Output: A confidence level (Decimal between 0 and 1) as to whether or not it is a legendary. Closer to 1 = Legendary, closer to 0 = Non-legendary.
