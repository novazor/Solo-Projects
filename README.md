### NLP Model (Tensorflow Keras)
- Sentiment Classification model using the public twitter_samples dataset from NLTK library.
- Allows an inputted tweet to receive either a positive or negative sentiment.
- Manual inputs available at the end

### Legendary Pokemon Predictor (PyTorch) 
- Confidence Prediction model predicting if a pokemon is legendary or not, outputting a confidence level.
- Input: The pokemon's numeric stats, such as its height, weight, base stats, type advantages, etc. Images are only used   for show.
- Output: A confidence level (Decimal between 0 and 1) as to whether or not it is a legendary. Closer to 1 = Legendary,    closer to 0 = Non-legendary.
- Utilizes several libraries including PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook demonstration included with comments
