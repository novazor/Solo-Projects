### Cat Classifier 
- Binary classifier in which you input an image. If it's an image of a cat, it outputs 1, else 0.
- Deep Neural network utilizing the dnn_functions file. I wrote these functions myself.

### Legendary Pokemon Predictor (Separate Jupyter Notebook demonstration included)
- Confidence Prediction model predicting if a pokemon is legendary or not, outputting a confidence level.
- Input: The pokemon's numeric stats, such as its height, weight, base stats, type advantages, etc. Images are only used for show.
- Output: A confidence level (Decimal between 0 and 1) as to whether or not it is a legendary. Closer to 1 = Legendary, closer to 0 = Non-legendary.
- Utilizes several libraries including PyTorch
- Datasets downloaded from Kaggle:
