Note - This repository is intended as a "gallery" of my work. You may pull these files to run them locally, but the datasets will need to be downloaded as well. All datasets are either externally linked here, or automatically install with the imported libraries.
### Spam Detector (PyTorch)
- NLP classification model on emails (String inputs), labeling as spam or not spam
- Utilizes Word2Vec embeddings and NLTK for tokenization
- 99% Accuracy
- Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishabharathi/email-spam-dataset


### Tweet Classifier (Tensorflow Keras)
- Sentiment Classification model using the public twitter_samples dataset from NLTK library.
- Allows an inputted tweet to receive either a positive or negative sentiment.
- Manual tweet inputs available

### Customer Churn Predictor (TensorFlow Keras)
- Predicts customer churn on a bank dataset
- Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset/data

### Handwritten (PyTorch)
- Image classification on inputted images of handwritten numbers
- Ten distinct classes (numbers 0-9)
-  Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/english-handwritten-characters-dataset

### Cifar10 Image classifier (TensorFlow Keras)
- Image classification with multiple classes on the public Cifar10 Dataset
- Classifies an input image among classes such as ship, automobile, deer, cat, etc.

### Life Expectancy Demo (No ML - only data analysis)
- Demonstration of cleaning, manipulating, and generating insights from a large dataset, including regression modeling
- Discrete steps + thought process explained with comments
