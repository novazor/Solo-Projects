And after reading the phrase for what seemed like\\nthe umpteen-thousandth time, we were idly wondering how many Irish\\ntech companies blamed their misfortunes \"on the global downturn\":\\nhttp://makeashorterlink.com/?S35A63392Oh, so it\\'s about 450 then.  Thanks, Google.*The death occurred recently of that great Irish washtub musician\\nLonnie Donegan.  RIP.  This seems like an apt time therefore to\\nreflect on his many accomplishments: his virtuoso playing of\\nutensil-based instruments, his worldwide commercial success, his\\nplace in history as King of Skiffle, and how he wiped billions of\\nyen off the value of the Tokyo stock market:\\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?selm=373A9C4F.61B@time.life\\n(\"panic and subsequent 10+% decline of Tokyo Stock Exchange when Reuters\\nadvised \\'Lonnie Donnegan\\' was dead\")\\nand also at\\nhttp://xsls.com?80\\n(\"to Japanese ears it sounded like Ronald Reagan\").*UCD\\'s Literary and Historical Society this week awarded an honorary\\nfellowship to the tediously brilliant American multidisciplarian Dr\\nNoam Chomsky.  Now the idea of some trifling college society\\nawarding a mere honorary fellowship actually sounds rather like an\\ninsult to us, considering that Niall Quinn and Marian Finucane were\\ngiven *degrees* by DIT the very next day, but then Chomsky\\napparently inspired some of Radiohead\\'s most caterwaulingly blunted\\nsongs, so we suppose it serves him right.  Anyway, if you\\'re an\\nadmirer of the great man\\'s hermeutic genius, linguistic philosophy\\nor contentious views on US foreign policy, perhaps you might also\\nappreciate his amazing interview of Tom Hanks:\\nhttp://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/tapes.htm#tomnnoamVery special thanks to IMHO\\'s London correspondent Ray Butler for\\nthis one.*Key IMHO contributor Sean Lynch quite realistically predicts a post-\\nBudget dole queue for all of us, and wonders if we\\'ll miss those\\ncash-and-job cow multinationals when they\\'re gone?   Not if their\\nIrish presence was as permanent and impressive as \"the world\\'s\\nleading risk and insurance services firm\", he concludes:\\nhttp://www.marsh.ie\\n(compare and contrast with, say, http://www.marsh.co.uk/)*Also: we\\'ve been remiss in the past in not featuring\\nEircomTribunal.com\\'s stalwart and righteous campaigning against\\nEircom\\'s crippling rates and crippled infrastructure in this\\ncountry.  Well, we aim to redress that right now, by pointing out\\n(1) Their \\'Banana Republic\\' international price comparison page at\\nhttp://www.eircomtribunal.com/dossier_banana_rep.html, which will\\nsurely make you mad enough to\\n(2) Download and print out their marvellously bitter \"No More\\nFavours For You, Mr Eircom Employee\" flyer from\\nhttp://www.eircomtribunal.com/counterstrike_a2_nomore.html, designed\\nto be stuck under the windshields of the ubiquitous and bilious\\nblue/orange Eircom vans.\\nNow if only EircomTribunal.com could somehow could retrieve that\\nmoney we all lost on bloody Eircom shares...\\n                          * * * * * * * * *\\nIMHO\\'S PICK: JOB....................IMHO HO HO (AND A BOTTLE OF RUM)\"FATHER CHRISTMAS on a bike - Student - Giving out FREEBIES - Four\\nweeks\".

Now this probably\\njust means selling snowboards or something equally tame, but in our\\nimagination we see IMHO readers hunting elephants, dogfighting in\\nbiplanes over the Wicklow Hills and abseiling down moon craters.\\nJust in case we\\'re right, any \"smart, experienced partner/investor\"\\nlooking for an \"equity stake/board position\" should \"express\"\\n\"interest\" to neptune@atomic.ie.You know, it might look like we\\'re giving these people free\\nadvertising, but by putting their email addresses on the public web,\\nwe\\'re actually GUARANTEEING them spam...\\n                          * * * * * * * * *\\nIMHO\\'S PICK: EVENT...........................Allow Us To DemonstrateFriday is BUY NOTHING DAY.  For the sake of your own mental health\\nand the socio-economic future, we urge you to give it a try.  It\\'s\\nnot that hard to get through 24 hours without a purchase, and those\\ncorporate balance sheets sure look funny with a big pre-Christmas\\nhole in them.The official home of BND is of course Adbusters\\n(http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/) and they have a run-down of\\nIrish activities at http://xsls.com?84... rather a disappointing line-up\\nat this late stage, although the Zombie-Shopping in Galway sounds\\nlike fun - shame they\\'re moving the day to Saturday, hopefully it\\'s\\nnot for purpose-defeating reasons (\"Friday?  Damn, I\\'m working the\\nlate shift at McDonald\\'s... how about Saturday?\").  In addition and\\nelsewhere you can expect bring-and-trade markets, flypostering, free\\nstuff, public speaking and all the other happy faces of democratic\\nconsumer agitation.  Punk\\'s not dead!  Party for your right to\\nfight!  No Logo!  Hare Hare!  And so on.*We\\'re now going to risk life and limb by mentioning an event which\\nis so diametrically opposed to the above that we might just bring\\nabout the heat-death of the Internet by combining them in the one\\nnewsletter.We speak of course of the benighted and spiritually-denuded sickness\\nof the TRILOGY FASHION SHOW in the RDS on December 4th, tickets\\nstarting at \"just E50\" (but rising to E395 + VAT, natch).  The\\nadvertising for this bleak celebration focuses entirely on \"the most\\nbeautiful women in the world\" who will grace the Simmonscourt\\nPavilion with their airbrushed emptiness: Tyra Banks, Sophie Dahl\\nand Anna Kournikova (not the virus) are the only names we recognise.\\nYou have to pore pretty closely over the small print of the press\\nads to divine that it\\'s the \"new Escada Collection\" (the who now?)\\nthey\\'re modelling.  And in an utterly appropriate and inevitable\\npartnership, tickets are available from the cultural sewage\\ntreatment system that is Ticketmaster.\\nhttp://www.cslassociates.ie/events/trilogy_fashion.htm\\n                          * * * * * * * * *\\nIMHO\\'S PICK: DOWNLOAD..................Transparent and UnaccountableGiven our internet focus and the subversive nature of our scurrilous\\npublishing agenda, there is only one possible download\\nrecommendation this week.  It\\'s the brilliant GHOSTZILLA browser, a\\ncreation of architectural genius which brings office escapism to\\nheady new heights.Designed to facilitate inconspicuous worktime browsing, Ghostzilla\\nsits quietly and invisibly in the background until you summon it\\nwith a special mouse movement.  It then adapts itself to your\\ncurrently-uppermost application, for example Micro$oft Word, leaving\\nWord\\'s toolbars intact while showing web pages in a subtle grayed-\\nout wash in the main window.  Images appear in a subdued two-tone\\nunless you summon them, and the overall effect is to make it look\\nlike you\\'re working exactly as you should be.  A casual glance from\\nyour Office Space boss as he paces past your cubicle shouldn\\'t\\ndetect anything that looks like browsing.  To think that someone\\ndevoted their life to creating something so wonderfully juvenile!\\nIt\\'s a beautiful thing.  Go ghosting at\\nhttp://www.ghostzilla.com.\\n                          * * * * * * * * *\\nIMHO\\'S PICK: INTERNET^HWS................................ON YER BIKERoll up, roll up roll up!

Read what they\\'re raving \\nabout and get yours at http://www.secureie.com/p/nnt1/\\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>01. READERS WRITE.  A Wisconsin subscriber wrote to express his displeasure \\nwith the links contained in Neat Net Tricks.  It seems he is bothered by \\nthe frequent pop-up ads and he felt that only those sites without the ads \\nshould be featured in NNT, particularly in the Premium issue. We replied \\nthat pop-ups can be annoying but, while not defending them, we must realize \\nthat they are a form of marketing in which the site owner hopes to recover \\nhis costs and possibly make a profit.  We suggested using a pop-up stopper \\n(there are lots of them on the Web) and ALT F4 will quickly close active \\npop-up windows.  Finally, we pointed out that no publication can guarantee \\nonly sites without pop-up ads.  As we\\'ve often said in the past, the \\nInternet isn\\'t free and never was.  Someone has to pay the freight and if \\nthose ads are unprofitable, they will cease to exist.02. EXTENSION SEARCH.  Next time a file extension has you puzzled, try the \\ndatabase at http://extsearch.com/ information.03. DUMB MESSAGES REVISITED.  Not long ago we mentioned a few dumb messages \\nwe see from our computer and invited others to share their favorite \\n\"dumbness.\"  A reader frequently gets a banner ad that asks \"Do you click \\non banner ads.\"  She asks, if you don\\'t, how do you click \"No\" without \\nclicking on the banner ad? Others galled at their computers crashing, then \\nsitting through the Scandisk operation and being reminded \"To avoid seeing \\nthis screen again, always shut down Windows properly\" as if it was their \\nfault. Another reader nominates the download site at \\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/NTWorkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp \\nfor having a really dumb comment.  After downloading a Windows update, it \\nsays:  \"How to Get Started -- You don\\'t need to do anything after \\ndownloading\" and he asks, \"what\\'s the point of downloading?\"  Still another \\nreader nominates the instruction manual for the Windows Internet \\nInformation Server (ILS) accessible only when ILS is operating.  Thus, the \\nentire section on troubleshooting a nonfunctional installation is \\ninaccessible at precisely the moment one needs to consult it.  But judging \\nby the sheer quantity of email, the top dumb instruction has to be the \\nmessage that \"Keyboard not detected, Press (whatever key) to \\nContinue.\"  Keep them coming and we\\'ll do it again in a future issue!04. XP TWEAK.  A recent article reminded readers of the neat things that \\ncan be done with TweakUI, but the XP operating system was not supported by \\nthe Tweak at that link.  Never fear, XP folks, you\\'ll find a whole array of \\npower tools included Tweak - all for XP - at \\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp .. . . . .1, 400+ Neat Net Tricks tips updated 4 times yearly for the word processing \\nformat of your choice, also in ebook format, plus extra features, \\ndownloadable and just $20 a year, a bargain (and a nice stocking stuffer \\nfor Santa) at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store.. . . . .05. HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS TOOL.  Windows98 users have a neat tool at their \\nfingertips without downloading.  Click on Start and Run and enter \"hwinfo \\n/ui\" without quotes.  The information displayed is color-coded.  Error \\nmessages are in red, warnings are in blue.  Green denotes registry entries, \\nConfiguration Manager information is in brown and file attributes are shown \\nin magenta.06. TRAINING WINDOWS.  One pet peeve is Windows\\' determination to identify \\na shortcut icon as \"Shortcut to (whatever)\"  This is pure redundancy, since \\nshortcuts are identified by an arrow.  And, with the added verbage of \\n\"Short cut to\" you can\\'t jump from one icon to another by pressing the \\nfirst letter (since they would all start with an \"s\".  If you keep removing \\n\"Shortcut to,\" Windows will eventually understand your intent and future \\nshortcuts won\\'t include \"Shortcut to\".07. HOLD THAT BUTTON.  The site at http://www.holdthebutton.com/ invites \\nyou to hold the mouse key down.  Now, before you hastily jump to \\nconclusions that there\\'s nothing more to this site, when you release the \\nbutton, you are told how you rank in stamina with other button \\nholders.  And when I took my turn at the controls, I found that the longest \\nrecord was a little over six hours, proving once again that some folks need \\nto get a life.08. HAGAI\\'S FREEWARE.  A baker\\'s dozen (13) freeware programs are at \\nhttp://www.hagai.com/download.asp?ProgType=Freeware . They include a bug \\nchecker, screen saver loader, clock, shutdown utility, CD autorun, boot \\neditor, menu, counter,icon viewer and editor, and more.09. ONLINE HELP.  Of limited scope, but considering that you can never get \\nenough help with your computer, try http://www.computerhope.com/oh.htm .. . . . .Apologies to those readers who were inconvenienced with multiple issues of \\nNNT Issue #137.  As luck would have it, Lyris (our mail server) had \\nhardware failure causing some of the repeated distribution. We\\'d like to \\ntell you that there will never be another problem in future mailings, and \\nif you\\'ll buy that, as the song goes, we have some oceanfront property in \\nArizona for sale.. . . . .IN NEXT WEEK\\'S NEAT NET TRICKS PREMIUM:  Google is generally accepted as \\nthe most popular search engine, but we show you another free download that \\nenhances Google, along with a way to \"Google\" without a browser.
